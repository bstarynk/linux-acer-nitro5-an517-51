Going thru a http://linuxfromscratch.org/ approach

## Use at your own risk. For Linux gurus only.

You could copy the `my-linux-*-config` into your [kernel](https://kernel.org/) source tree.

You may physically break or brick your laptop.

Then you want to edit the `build.zsh` script and run it.

See http://starynkevitch.net/Basile/ for more about me and perhaps

The laptop was bought for [RefPerSys](http://refpersys.org/) development.
